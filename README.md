# Spotify-Clone
I developed a static Spotify clone interface using only HTML and CSS.

The design closely replicates the look and feel of Spotify's web player, including a sidebar menu, top navigation bar, album artwork display, and music control section.

This project helped me strengthen my CSS layout skills using Flexbox and Grid, while focusing on responsive design and visual accuracy without JavaScript or any frameworks.
